    <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, this is Jiaze. Iâ€™m an AI Alignment Research Engineer.</p>
<p>I am interested in AI Safety, not only in improving the capabilities of LLMs, but more importantly in how to align a human-level AI with humans.</p>
<p>In my daily life, I am quite interested in the views of the Stoicism and am currently reading related philosophical books.</p>
<p>Recently, what I have been doing is a combination of two things: on the one hand, I am using the views of Stoicism to improve myself; on the other hand, my main research focuses on how LLMs can improve their capabilities through self-improvment.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-blog">About the blog</h2>
<p>In the past year, I have read many excellent blogs written by inspiring individuals. I also hope to document things that interest me to see if I can inspire myself or others who read my blog.</p>
<p>The name of the blog comes from: when we find bugs, we always say that something <strong>seems wrong</strong> here. Finding what&rsquo;s wrong seems to be the beginning of success.</p>
<p>In daily work and study, it is also the case that when we find something seems wrong, that is when we can make improvements.</p>
<p>I hope everyone can notice things that seems wrong in one&rsquo;s life, then follow the clues to find the root causes, fix the problems, and achieve self-improvement.</p>
