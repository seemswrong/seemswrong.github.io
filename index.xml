      <description>About Me Hi, this is Jiaze. Iâ€™m an AI Alignment Research Engineer.&#xA;I am interested in AI Safety, not only in improving the capabilities of LLMs, but more importantly in how to align a human-level AI with humans.&#xA;In my daily life, I am quite interested in the views of the Stoicism and am currently reading related philosophical books.&#xA;Recently, what I have been doing is a combination of two things: on the one hand, I am using the views of Stoicism to improve myself; on the other hand, my main research focuses on how LLMs can improve their capabilities through self-improvment.</description>
